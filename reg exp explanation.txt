To match the strings "(low)" and "(low, <number>)" in Go, where <number> can be any integer, you can use the following regular expression:

\((low)(,\s*-?\d+)?\)

Here is the breakdown of the regular expression:

\( and \) match the literal parentheses.
(low) matches the exact string "low".
(,\s*-?\d+)? matches an optional part that includes:
	, matches the comma.
	\s* matches any whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, etc.) that might occur after the comma (optional).
	-? matches an optional minus sign for negative numbers.
	\d+ matches one or more digits.
? makes the entire ,\s*-?\d+ part optional, allowing for the match of just (low).
